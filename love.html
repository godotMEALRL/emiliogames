<p>When I use &mdash;--- It means the girl that I like</p>
<p>Cuz I aint Ready for that drama</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&mdash;--- I was hoping this song would not come out</p>
<p>But the thought in my my mind&hellip; went out</p>
<p>As soon as I saw you <span style="color: #999999;">As soon as I saw you</span></p>
<p>&mdash;--- Im such a fool</p>
<p>I dont know rules</p>
<p>Im so insecure</p>
<p>Thats for sure</p>
<p>Im so annoying</p>
<p>Noise from m mouth just keep growing</p>
<p>Ima Fool</p>
<p>But ima fool who fell for you</p>
<p>Its so true</p>
<p>&mdash;-- When I see you my Mind is oblivious</p>
<p>Its trivia Everyday Why waste my time</p>
<p>Thinking bout you</p>
<p>But Godamn i cant stop thinkin bout</p>
<p>This song is so trash</p>
